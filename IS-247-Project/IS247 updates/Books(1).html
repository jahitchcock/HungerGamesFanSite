<p>Twenty-four are forced to enter. Only the winner survives.

In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. 
Each year, the districts are forced by the Capitol to send one boy and one girl between the ages
of twelve and eighteen to participate in the Hunger Games,
a brutal and terrifying fight to the death â€“ televised for all of Panem to see.

Survival is second nature for sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who struggles to feed 
her mother and younger sister by secretly hunting and gathering beyond the fences of District 12.
When Katniss steps in to take the place of her sister in the Hunger Games, she knows it may be her death sentence. 
If she is to survive, she must weigh survival against humanity and life against love.

<p> Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the annual Hunger Games with fellow district tribute Peeta Mellark.
But it was a victory won by defiance of the Capitol and their harsh rules. Katniss and Peeta should be happy.

After all, they have just won for themselves and their families a life of safety and plenty. 
But there are rumors of rebellion among the subjects, and Katniss and Peeta, to their horror,
are the faces of that rebellion.

The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Suzanne Collins continues the amazing story of 
Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire, the second novel of the phenomenal Hunger Games trilogy.

<p>Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice.
But now that she's made it out of the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. 
The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge.

Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. 
And what's worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. 
Not Katniss's family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. 

The Hunger Games trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.
