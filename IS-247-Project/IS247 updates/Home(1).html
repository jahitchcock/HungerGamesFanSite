				     After winning the 74th Hunger Games in the previous novel, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return home to District 12, the poorest sector in the country of Panem. 
				     On the day that Katniss and Peeta are to start a "Victory Tour" of the country, 
				     President Snow visits unexpectedly and tells Katniss that he is angry with her for breaking the rules at the end of the last Hunger Games, which permitted both Peeta and Katniss to win. 
				     Snow tells Katniss that when she defied the Capitol, she inspired rebellion in the districts.
				     The first stop on the Victory Tour is District 11, the home of Katniss's deceased friend and ally in the Hunger Games, Rue.
				      During the ceremony, Katniss delivers a brief speech, thanking the people of District 11 for their participants in the Games. 
				      When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Katniss used in the arena to tell Rue that she was safe. 
				      The song acts as a signal and everyone salutes Katniss, using the same gesture that she used to say farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man and two others are executed.
                      Katniss and Peeta travel to the rest of the twelve districts and the Capitol.
